# Stock-Plotting
A small plotting application that is focused on stock prices. In stock trading, the idea is to buy a stock when it is priced low and sell it at a later time point when the price is high which will net the profit of the difference between each. Of course, this must be done by predicting when prices are at their highest and lowest points and some insight can be garnered from examining historical data for stock prices. The application allows for easy analysis of a simple data file containing times/prices for stocks and display of their information in simple text plots.
Use MakeFile to compile the program and ./stock_main data/stock-ascending.txt 10 3 9 to run the program. After main, comes the txt file that contains the stock information and the height of the plot following the specific intervals we want to look at.
